## Data 

Salary data collected by hand from stat.gov stats: https://stat.gov.kz/

Inflation data taken from the World Bank for 2007 to 2021: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=KZ

Additional inflation rates for 2022 and 2023 taken from Statista: https://www.statista.com/statistics/436183/inflation-rate-in-kazakhstan/

We downoladed data from these sources and placed it in the acrhive folder as csv_warnged.csv.

We have processed the source data to make it normalized and derived  several aggregated datasets from it:

* `archive/csv_wranged.csv` - sour—Åe data for salaries
* `data/prediction.csv` - wranged and preprocessed data
* `data/csv_expanded.csv` - expanded main dataset which predicts populations from 2023 to 2050
* `datapackage.json` - conatins all of the key information about our dataset

## Scripts

* `wrang.py`- cleaning and wranging the source data script
* `expand.py` - uses main dataset and expands it to 8 steps to make animation smoother
* `animate.py` - uses matplotlib to create an infographic about populations over the inflation and exports it to a gif file
* `datapack.py` - creating datapckage.json file that conatinsall meatadata
* `main.py` - launches all scripts step by step

## Visualization

Final result is visualized data that displays average salary and inflation data
